# Python-curriculum

This is a series of Reveal.js slides designed to teach Python. The course associated with this curriculum is oriented around students own individual projects. These slides just provide a minimal baseline of Python before the real lesson begins: in working on a real-world project.

# Tentative contents

- Lesson 1:
    * Arithmetic
    * `+`. `-`, `/`, `*`, parens, `**`, `//`, `%`
    * Example: calculator
    * Variables
    * Example: sales tax
    * Example: volume
    * How to print
    * _Big picture idea_: Computers are good at doing precise operations, whereas humans are better at loose tasks
    * _Students will be able to_: use Python as a calculator with variables for math homework

- Lesson 2:
    * Lists
    * Example: simple database (using `in` operator)
    * Strings
    * How to deal with errors
    * For loops
    * Example: approximate pi
    * Example: sum of first n positive integers
    * _Big picture idea_: Computers can do a ton of boring things quickly and accurately (and quite happily). You can leverage that power if you can program.
    * _Students will be able to_: automate repetetive arithmetic tasks with Python
    * _Rationale_: the reason I am introducing loops here is to quickly give students something they can actually use. If-statements are kind of simplistic and useless without loops.

- Lesson 3:
    * If
    * (Bring up elif here?)
    * Boolean expressions
    * Difference between = and ==
    * Example: simple database revisited
    * While, continue, break
    * Example: Test the Collatz conjecture
    * _Big picture idea_: What control flow is and how indentation is used in Python
    * _Students will be able to_: automate more complicated tasks with Python

- Lesson 4:
    * Functions
    * (not bringing up higher-order functions or lambda expressions yet)
    * Example: revisit sum of first n positive integers
    * Example: simple equation solver
    * Imports
    * Example: batch rename files (use os)
    * Example: graphing functions (us matplotlib)
    * Example: what weekday will your 100th birthday fall on? (use datetime)
    * Example: encrypt stuff with secret code (use pycrypto)
    * Example: write timer function (use datetime)
    * More function arguments
    * List splat
    * Keyword arguments
    * _Big picture idea_: You can do more if you leverage existing code by using existing functions.
    * _Students will be able to_: use library functions (such as, random numbers, file renaming, plotting graphs, talk to twitter)
    * _Rational_: Introducing imports lets you do impressive things early on in the course. This will be most useful for the personal projects.

- Lesson 4:
    * Intro to objects
    * Instances
    * Copying
    * Attributes and methods
    * (not bringing up user-defined classes here)
    * Lists, revisited
    * Example: placing orders at a restaurant
    * Dicts
    * Example: decoding state abbreviations
    * Strings, revisited
    * Example: simple database revisited
    * Example: word count
    * Example: use twitter API
    * _Big picture idea_: Different objects are good for different things. Use them together.
    * _Students will be able to_: use built-in data structures to solve problems

- Lesson 5:
    * Classes
    * Inheritance
    * Modules
    * The rest depends on what the students want to build.
    * Introduce Kivy?
    * Introduce Pygame?
    * Introduce SL4A?
    * Introduce django?
